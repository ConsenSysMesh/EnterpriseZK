## **Proof of Location and Membership Circuit**
This folder showcases the zero knowledge circuit work, utilizing the GROTH16 prover system, testing on the BN254 curve, performed to generate and verify flat distance and membership proofs within a specificed maximum distance from a specfied center point.

This zero-knowledge circuit can be used in a many scenarios. The original scenario this circuit was developed for was to prove that a vehicle is on a specific car dealer lot, and belongs to the fleet of the dealer on that dealer's lot.
